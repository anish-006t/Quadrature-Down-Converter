\# Quadrature Down Converter



\## 📌 Overview

This project implements a \*\*Quadrature Down Converter\*\* using LTSpice to perform frequency translation of high-frequency signals to baseband. Such systems are widely used in \*\*RF communication\*\*, \*\*modulation/demodulation\*\*, and \*\*signal processing\*\*.



The design consists of three main stages:

\- Oscillator

\- Mixer

\- Low-Pass Filter

\## ⚙️ System Architecture



The complete system performs:

\\\[

f\_{out} = f\_{in} - f\_{osc}

\\]



It generates \*\*in-phase (I)\*\* and \*\*quadrature (Q)\*\* components by mixing the input signal with cosine and sine local oscillator signals.

\## 🧩 Components



\### 🔹 1. Oscillator (Bubba Oscillator)

\- Generates sine and cosine waves

\- Frequency: \~100 kHz  

\- Phase difference: \~90°  

\- Built using op-amp based RC phase-shift network



\---



\### 🔹 2. Mixer

\- Implemented using a \*\*MOSFET operating in triode region\*\*

\- Performs signal multiplication:

\\\[

V\_{out} \\propto V\_{in} \\cdot V\_{osc}

\\]

\- Produces sum and difference frequencies:

\\\[

f\_{out} = f\_{in} \\pm f\_{osc}

\\]

\### 🔹 3. Low-Pass Filter (LPF)

\- RC filter with cutoff ≈ 2 kHz  

\- Removes high-frequency components  

\- Extracts the baseband signal:

\\\[

f\_{out} = f\_{in} - f\_{osc}

\\]
